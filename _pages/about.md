I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis. I am advised by [Prof. Hao-Chuan Wang](http://www.haochuanwang.info/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and Social Computing. I build interactive systems to support online knowledge sharing and acquisition. More specifically, my dissertation work aims to enhance interativity of online teaching and learning from the angle of computer-mediated communication. 

Prior to joining UC Davis, I received my B.S. degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Minnesota.
