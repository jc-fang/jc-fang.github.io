I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis. I am advised by [Prof. Hao-Chuan Wang](http://www.haochuanwang.info/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and Educational Technology. I study how to build interactive systems to better support remote knowledge sharing and computer-mediated communication.

Before coming to UC Davis, I received my B.S. degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Minnesota.
